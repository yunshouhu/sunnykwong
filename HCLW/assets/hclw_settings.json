// endpointed by the initial, middle and final points.
// the ordinates used are (x,y) in a 640x480 palette that gets scaled to

// the z coordinate is virtual, and controls the scaling of the flare.

// 
// One more note:  You can add as many flares as you want.  Do you want to fill
// all the channels?  Knock yourself out.
// The last flare is *always* the searchlight.
